      <description>Registration for an activity is possible through the form which can be found in the last information e-mail that was sent out on Tuesday the 22nd of November.
There are limited capacities for each activity, so full = full. For the canal tours, it is important to be on time at the boat location as the tour boat will leave on time. NB: choosing an activity is optional, you are also free to use the activity afternoon as you see fit and thus not fill in this form.</description>
