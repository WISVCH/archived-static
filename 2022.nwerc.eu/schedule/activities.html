<p><em>Cruel World of Concurrent Beasts &ndash; Concurrency Challenges in System Software, by speaker Diogo Behrens.</em>
<em>To take most performance out of the modern CPUs, developers have to make their algorithms aware of hardware peculiarities, such as caches, cores, etc. That greatly complicates implementations. As a developer, one has to face the dilemma between easy reasoning and best performance. In this talk, we will review challenges often neglected in university courses: concurrency, weak memory models, and NUMA domains. My goal is to raise your awareness to these issues and motivate you to think on how to tackle them in your future career.</em></p>
<p><em>We provide the prize at Q&amp;A session for the wonderful answers: Huawei Freebuds!</em></p>
