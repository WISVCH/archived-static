prepared for this great event. Please check the pages for the latest system information and the
schedule.
We want to remind you of the following:

The contest machines will be desktops. We do not allow you to replace the keyboard or mouse.
During the contest, you are only allowed to use your Team Reference Document (TRD) as reference material. You may
bring three identical copies of the document per team, clearly marked with the university and team name. For
specifications on the TRD, please check the online booklet. Your TRD should be handed in at registration. It is not
possible to print the TRD at the contest site.
This year there will be no water bottle in the goody bag. We advise you to bring your own refillable water bottle. The
water bottles can be filled at all water taps. The water from Dutch water taps can be drunk safely.
We will not be providing perishable cups this year. You will receive a mug in your goody bag to use during the
weekend. If you wish, you can also bring your own travel mug.
Please be sure to bring everything you want to use during the contest, including mascots and snacks, on Saturday to
the test session. You are not allowed to bring anything on Sunday, except unmodified liquid containers.

The program booklet will be online this year. It contains a lot of useful information about the contest and the
companies making this contest possible. You can read the booklet here."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.143.0"><meta name=robots content="index, follow"><link rel=stylesheet href="../../ananke/css/main.min.ef31e9f9d14e10b25116f00f91472f9442323b50ac4e6b9da1fdfba4132d5e82.css"><link rel=canonical href="index.html"><meta property="og:url" content="https://2024.nwerc.eu/news/nwerc-last-info/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="NWERC 2024"><meta property="og:title" content="Last Information"><meta property="og:description" content="The 2024 ICPC Northwestern Europe Regional Contest will take place this weekend, and we hope that you and your team are prepared for this great event.
